        <p id = "footer-paragraph">Lorem Ipsum is simply
             dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
              Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text 
              ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley 
              of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It h
              as survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
               electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It
                was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset 
                sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
            and more recently with
             desktop publishing software like 
             Aldus PageMaker including versions
              of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
